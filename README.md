# Travello
 A mock travel website created in Django. The goal of this project was to create my first django website. Previous to this website, I only had experience with Python, and had never used it for Web Development. 
 
# What Skills Did I learn?
 - MVT (Model View Template)
   - This project covered a wide variety of topics that are core to the django web framework, MVT being one of them.
   - This project taught me the seperation of responsibility in django 
    - The Model: This is the formation of the data base columns. The idea of the model allows for data to have a key-value pair relationship for easy database trasactions, and 
      limits the need for long and complex SQL queries
    - The View: This controls the logic behind the website. The views contain the main functionality and backend processing for the website.
    - The Template: This is what the user sees. This is where the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hangout to create a beautiful frontend that can display all of the information
      brought forward by your views.
